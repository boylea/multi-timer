Instructions for use of Snail Timer:

Press start to start the main timer. This will record the session duration, and it must be running to start and stop the individual snail timers. Once the main timer is running, you may use the number keys on your keyboard to toggle the start and stop of the timers. Once you are done press the stop button. 

To save these times to file press the save button. If you have not already selected a file, you will be prompted to open or create one.  The recorded times will be appended to (not overwrite) the selected file. Note that pressing save multiple times will append the same data again. You may edit the name of the file in the field, or delete it to be prompted for a new file.

Pressing re-start will clear the previously captured times, and start the main timer.

The output is saved to text file, and will have the following format:

The first field is the  date and time the start button on the timer was pressed.
Column 1: Header info
Column 2-9: snail start and stop times. Each column has the start time, and stop time (relative to the time the master timer was started) for each snail, and therefore there is an even number of rows for each snail.

There is an empty row and then the total opening time, mean opening time, and the number of openings for each snail.

The last row contains the total session time.
